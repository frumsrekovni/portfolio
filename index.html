                I am a software developer born in 1995.
                I got a half-assed computer engineering degree and 
                a full-assed computer dependency.

                I remedy this vice by hiking small mountains and weightlifting.

                My body survives by applying an excellent internet prowess for processing various data used for machine learning.
                My mind survives by developing projects that I find meaningful, in whatever framework is suited for it.

                Masaaki Yuasa, Hayao Miyazaki, Naoko Yamada, Eiichiro Oda, Masashi Kishimoto, Shigeru Miyamoto, Hidetaka Miyazaki and Masahiro Sakurai
                are to blame for sparking and fostering my awe towards Japanese media. Which never stopped,
                I keep finding more. Recently(2022), mainly literature, just to really hammer in the guilt of not knowing the language. Stuff like mandatory ancient scripts by
                Miyamoto Musashi and Yagyu Munenori are crazy for even existing, but also dipped my toes in the obvious modern must-read texts by Haruki Murakami and Yukio Mishima.

            <li>Grew up watching <span id="timeline_tv_show" onclick="_get_Random_Tv_Show()">Xena: Warrior Princess</span> <br>
                Born and raised in Södertälje, Sweden.
                After an entire elementary school worth of <span id="timeline_game" onclick="_get_Random_Game()">halo</span> and
                 <span id="timeline_sport" onclick="_get_Random_Sport()">ice-hockey</span> I entered an upper secondary school
                that had a great international focus even though I had a non-existent retention of my Spanish classes. University prep is
                what you do. Nobody told me to go,
                yet I gravitated towards it and had the impression that it is what one does. <br>What should I do?
            </li>
            <li>18 years old<br>
                Prep school is done. I'm ready for university now with all of these formulas and random languages that I do not care about.
                Apart from some family restaurant odd-jobs, my entire academic career at this point is basically my entire life. What is a working life even like? Well, nepotism sure is a virtue... 
                so I quickly found myself as a traffic flagger for a construction company, which in reality also meant construction fence builder.
                Never in my life have I gained this much appreciation towards air-conditioning. <br>Why am I doing this?</li>
            <li>University<br>
                I moved to Linköping and entered Linköping University for Computer Science. I loved using my bulky computer ever since I was a kid. This fits right in—I'm by myself now.
                Shared dorm life is a time that I'll never forget. But no time to digest this fact. Computer Science doesn't give a shit that you like 
                playing computer games and that you know your differential equations.
                The work ethic and discipline required here swiftly knocked me to the ground. 
                I grit my teeth through building entire operative systems in C, 
                baby-sitting a little machine learning virtual rocket ship that needs to learn to hover by itself and often moving literal ones and zeros in order to test 
                microchips. This was my introduction to the world of programming and computer science. It was equal parts amazingly cool and amazingly laborious.
                This reality in combination with an ever looming cloud of shaky motivations I eventually cracked. I dropped out with 135 out of 180 credits completed.
                <br>Who am I doing any of this for?
            </li>
            <li>Flashback<br>
                University is done. I'm ready for ——— now with all of these formulas and random programming languages that I do not care about. 
                I ended up working at the beautiful boat hostel STF af Chapman & Skeppsholmen in central Stockholm.
                My title being, let me see: receptionist, waiter, barista, sandwich artist uhm vomit sweeper...
                A super exciting job that made me meet more people in a year than I have collectively met in my entire life.
                I gathered plenty of valuable experiences and lessons in communications, people skills and in an overtly melancholic fashion an appreciation towards meditation.
                Working in the tourism sector when the COVID-19 pandemic hit was pure hell. Tested my psyche in ways I didn't know was possible. 
                A shitstorm of an ordeal to the extent that it repeatedly forced me to sit down and learn to look into myself. 
                Perhaps start to chip away at some questions that have always been there.

            <li>Git Committing<br>
                Emptying your mind in order to throw in some boulders in order to stir up some of that caked-on mind sediment required a lot of deliberate work.
                Scooping up whatever comes to the surface and analyzing it. This conscious observation of my feelings towards motivation and work
                has resulted in me coding and learning actively again. Programming in my mind was just another subject and in my head one and the same with
                computer science courses that lacked meaning to me. Coming to terms with the scarily simple reality that it's ok to make
                anything that you find meaningful and by your own volition is freeing. My existing coding knowledge happens to be 
                an incredibly useful tool for acting on this. I am having fun trying to commit to git every day no matter what it is and I have been at it since early
                2022.
