                Born and raised in a suburb close to Stockholm, Sweden.
                After an entire elementary school worth of <span id="timeline_game" onclick="_get_Random_Game()">halo</span> and
                 <span id="timeline_sport" onclick="_get_Random_Sport()">ice-hockey</span> I entered a language upper secondary school
                with a non-existent retention of my spanish classes because it was the only local school that offered university 
                preparing math classes.
            </li>
            <li>18 years old<br>
                With language school done there is nothing more I want to do but to not learn formulas for a second. Nepotism is a virtue.. 
                so I quickly found myself as a traffic flagger for a construction company, which in reality also meant construction fence builder.
                Never in my life have I gained this much appreciation toward air-conditioning.</li>
            <li>University<br>
                Entered Linköping University for Computer Science. The work ethic and discipline required here swiftly knocked me to the ground. I grit my teeth through building entire operative systems in C, 
                building a little machine learning virtual rocket ship that needs to learn to hover by itself and often moving literal ones and zeros in order to test 
                microchips. This was my introduction to the world of programming and computer science and it was equal parts amazingly cool and amazingly laborious.
            </li>
            <li>Flashback<br>
                With university done there is nothing more I want to do but to not learn formulas for a second. 
                I ended up working front desk for a hostel which made me meet more people in a few years than I have collectively met in my entire life.
                Good for developing people skills but in the end did not feel like my calling.
            </li>
            <li>Git Committing<br>
                With proper self-reflection and consciously dusting of my feelings built up towards programming I eventually started actively code again.
                Programming was in my mind one and the same with computer science courses.
                Accepting the simple reality that it's ok to program anything that you want and by your own volition is very freeing
                and I've been running on this high since the start of 2022. Having fun trying to git commit everyday as per 
                <a href="https://medium.com/@rieckpil/30-minutes-every-day-for-your-craft-committing-code-to-github-for-365-consecutive-days-eec8b73b5105">this blogpost</a>
                and following Robert "Uncle Bob" Martin's ever eloquent ideas regarding honing your craft and building a routine.
